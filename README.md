# About the browser support...
# The only things that could go wrong should be :
#	1. linear-gradient Supports from IE10
#	2. justify-content Supports from IE11
#	3. align-items     Supports from IE11
#	4. calc function   android partial support from 2013.Doesnt support divide and multiply , but i didnt use them. 
# Otherwise it should not be a disaster.
